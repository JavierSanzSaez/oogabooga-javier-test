# Blockchain Event Listener

This project is a TypeScript application that listens for events on a blockchain. It connects to the blockchain, listens for specific events, and processes them accordingly.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd blockchain-event-listener
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To start the event listener, run the following command:
```
npm start
```

This will initialize the event listener and begin listening for events on the blockchain.
